##Problem
Iâ€™m providing you with n `digits`, where each digit is a random `integer` from 0 to 9. Solve the
following:
1. From the array of n `digits`, create two `numbers` where the sum of those two numbers
is the highest possible value from any combination of the n non-repeated digits. You
cannot use the same digit more than once and each digit must be used.
2. Write code to solve the above problem, programmatically. For this step, make sure you
provide code that works, regardless of how efficient it is. Use any language you want.
3. Make the code better. This will depend on the first solution. Use proper programming
fundamentals, proper math, reduce the number of loops, minimize memory usage, etc.
Write down what you are attempting to improve. We want to know if you understand
what could be better, regardless of your inability to implement the improvements.
4. Show us the evolution of your code. i.e. Send us your first answer and send us your final
answer.
5. Send us instructions as to how we may execute your code and test it.
Examples:
Digits: 9, 4, 2, 7, 9 ,0
Output: 1912
Digits: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2
Output: 432
Digits: 9, 1, 8, 2, 7, 3
Output: 1803
Digits: 5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 0
Output: 1471
Digits: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
Output: 0
Digits: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Output: 222
Digits: 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1
Output: 36432
Digits: 1
Output: 1
Extra Credit
1. Allow for n `digits` and m `numbers`.
Examples:
Digits: 3, 6, 4, 9, 0, 1
Numbers: 4
Output: 158
Digits: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4
Numbers: 3
Output: 484
